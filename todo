TODO
    Prevent multiple spaces from messing up display of overlaycharacters.
    Have different representation of space characters in error char list.
    Add countdown from three when start button is pressed
    Add proptypes

ISSUES
    Might need to use js to work out cursor position / selection object, and enforce that it's at the end. Or find out where click is and update state's currentPosition.

    typing container onClick prevent default doesn't work


TO IMPROVE
    Find better way of counting and formatting error characters than current way of converting from array of characters to obj of {char : count} back to array to sort


LONGTERM TODO
    Ability to choose a category you are interested in, and query wikipedia for a bit of text from an article tagged with that category! Make it interesting!
    Visual representation of keyboard with error key count values overlayed.
    Keep track of progress / high scores etc in localStorage.
